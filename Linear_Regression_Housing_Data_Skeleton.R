#Part 1 - Data analysis
# Load required libraries
# optional installation step, if you don't have the libraries installed:
# install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr","car"))
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(car)
# 1. Load the data

# 2. Summary statistics

# 3. Calculate mean, mode and median, as well as the standard deviation for each variable
# Mode function

# Print results

# 4. Compute the correlation between each pair of variables

# Part 2 - Data visualization
# Create a histogram of house prices with styling and 8 bins

#Part 3 - Hypothesis testing
# 1. Define "high" and "low" crime rates based on the median of the Crime.Rate variable

# 2. Additional: Check for assumptions
# For a t-test, it's essential to check for normality & homogeneity of variance.

# Check normality for each group

# 3. Conduct an independent two-sample t-test

# 4. Print the results

# Part 4 - Linear regression
# for predicting the median home value with the average rooms variable
